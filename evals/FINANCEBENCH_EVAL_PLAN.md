# FinanceBench Evaluation Plan

**Purpose:** Use the [FinanceBench](https://github.com/patronus-ai/financebench) benchmark
to verify that the documents this project extracts from SEC EDGAR — and the RAG
pipeline built on top of them — actually produce correct, grounded answers.

**Status:** PLAN (Blockers RESOLVED)
**Owner:** TBD
**Related audit items:** `PROJECT_ERROR_AUDIT.yaml` → **H1** (FIXED), **H2** (FIXED), **M1** (FIXED), **M2** (FIXED), **M3** (FIXED)

---

## 1. What FinanceBench is and why it fits this project

FinanceBench (Patronus AI, 2023) is a benchmark for financial-document question
answering. Each item pairs a natural-language question with a gold answer and the
**exact evidence** (source filing, page number, evidence text) it was derived from.

- **Open subset:** ~150 questions, publicly released (HuggingFace `PatronusAI/financebench`
  + GitHub). Full set is 10,231 questions (gated).
- **Document types:** 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, earnings releases — **the same forms**
  `etl/extract_edgar.py` already targets (`form_types=['10-K','10-Q','8-K']`).
- **Question types:** `domain-relevant` (metric lookup), `metrics-generated`
  (numeric/derived), `novel-generated` (reasoning).
- **Companies:** large-cap US issuers (3M, Apple, Amazon, Boeing, Coca-Cola, Pfizer, …),
  all of which the Finviz-built ticker universe (`config/update_tickers.py`) covers.

> ⚠️ Verify field names / counts against the current release before coding — the schema
> below reflects the 2023–2024 open subset and may drift.

**Mapping to our code:**

| FinanceBench needs | Our component | Table |
|---|---|---|
| Structured metrics (revenue, EPS, assets…) | `extract_edgar.run_edgar_facts_etl` + `_CONCEPTS` | `edgar_facts` |
| Filing-level retrieval | `embed_edgar.run_embed_edgar_etl` | `edgar_embeddings` |
| End-to-end answers | `rag_engine.ask_rag` / `EDGARFactsRetriever` | both |

---

## 2. Objectives (what "properly evaluated" means here)

We evaluate the extraction pipeline at **three independent layers**, weakest-coupling first:

- **E1 — Extraction fidelity (structured):** Do the numbers we parsed into `edgar_facts`
  match FinanceBench gold answers for metric questions? *Tests `extract_edgar` directly,
  no LLM, no retrieval.* This is the most direct answer to "are the documents we extract
  properly evaluated."
- **E2 — Oracle answer quality:** Given the *correct* gold passage, can the LLM produce the
  gold answer? *Tests generation in isolation (`rag_engine` prompt + provider), removing
  retrieval as a variable.*
- **E3 — Open-book RAG (end-to-end):** Can `ask_rag()` retrieve the right evidence from our
  own embedded corpus **and** answer correctly? *Tests the whole pipeline.*

Each layer isolates a different failure mode, so a regression points at a specific module.

---

## 3. Prerequisites / blockers (DO THESE FIRST)

These are not optional — the eval is invalid without them.

1. **Fix H1 (vector-store path mismatch).** `embed_tickers`/`embed_edgar` write embeddings
   into `ibkr.duckdb` (via `get_connection`), but `rag_engine` reads `vectors.duckdb`
   (`DUCKDB_PATH`). Until one store is canonical, E3 measures an empty corpus. The audit
   confirmed both tables exist with 0 rows and that running `--job embed-tickers` would leave
   `vectors.duckdb` still empty. Fix: point `rag_engine.DUCKDB_PATH` at `DB_PATH`
   (`ibkr.duckdb`), then delete the orphan `data/vectors.duckdb`. *Blocks E3.*

2. **Fix H2 (missing chat providers as judge).** `chat_engine._PROVIDERS` only implements
   `deepseek` and `mimo`. Unknown providers (`openai`, `anthropic`, `ollama`) silently fall
   back to the deepseek config, raising "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY is not set" when a different key
   is configured. Since `rag_engine` imports `_BASE_URL`, `_MODEL`, and `_KEY_ENV` directly
   from `chat_engine`, the judge for E2/E3 inherits this gap. Until H2 is fixed, the only
   usable judge providers are **deepseek** and **mimo**. *Blocks E2/E3 for all other providers.*

3. **Fix M1 (dead `edgar_embeddings` + non-idempotent INSERT).** No retriever in `rag_engine`
   queries `edgar_embeddings`; `EDGARFactsRetriever` uses the structured `edgar_facts` table.
   Additionally, `embed_edgar.py:116` uses a bare `INSERT` (not `INSERT OR REPLACE`), so
   `evals/financebench/ingest.py` will accumulate duplicate chunk rows every time it runs a
   question's filing through the embedder. Fix both before Phase 4:
   - Add an `EDGAREmbeddingsRetriever` to `rag_engine._combined_retriever`, or accept that
     E3 only exercises the `edgar_facts` structured path (document the scope limitation).
   - Change the INSERT to deduplicate by `(ticker, accession, chunk_index)` or delete
     existing rows for `(ticker, accession)` before re-inserting. *Blocks idempotent ingest.*

4. **Fix M3 (retriever private-API bypass).** `_combined_retriever` calls
   `._get_relevant_documents(query, run_manager=None)` directly on each retriever instead of
   using the public `.invoke()` API. None of the current implementations dereference
   `run_manager`, but a LangChain version bump could change that and silently break E3
   retrieval without raising an exception. Fix before E3 goes into CI. *Makes E3 fragile.*

5. **Period coverage gap.** `embed_edgar.fetch_latest_10k_with_downloader` fetches only the
   **latest single 10-K**. FinanceBench questions reference **specific historical periods**
   (e.g. FY2022 10-K, Q3-2023 10-Q) and **8-Ks**. The eval harness must ingest the *exact*
   `(company, doc_type, doc_period)` each selected question cites — extend the downloader to
   accept a target filing, or pre-load FinanceBench's own provided PDFs as the oracle corpus.

6. **Facts coverage gap.** `edgar_facts` stores only `10-K`/`10-Q` and the 11 concepts in
   `_CONCEPTS`. E1 is only valid for metric questions whose concept+period is in scope —
   filter the question set accordingly and report coverage honestly (don't score questions
   we structurally can't answer).

7. **Pin `tabulate` (M2).** E2/E3 call `chat_engine._summarise()`, which uses
   `df.to_markdown()` — a `tabulate` dependency. `tabulate` is not in `requirements.txt`.
   On a clean install it is silently swallowed (returns "Query returned N rows." instead of
   a formatted summary), degrading every judge call. Add `tabulate` to `requirements.txt`
   before running E2/E3. *Degrades E2/E3 summaries silently.*

---

## 4. Dataset acquisition & licensing

- **Source:** `datasets.load_dataset("PatronusAI/financebench")` (or vendored JSONL from the
  GitHub repo). Gold PDFs are referenced per item; the repo provides retrieval URLs/scripts.
- **License:** open subset is **CC-BY-NC-4.0** (non-commercial). ✅ fine for internal eval;
  ❌ do not ship gold answers/PDFs in a commercial artifact. Keep under `evals/data/` and
  gitignore it (add `evals/data/` to `.gitignore`).
- **Cache:** store the normalized question set once at `evals/data/financebench_open.jsonl`
  with fields we use: `id, question, answer, company, ticker, doc_type, doc_period,
  question_type, evidence[] (text, doc_name, page)`.
- **Ticker mapping:** FinanceBench keys on company/doc name, not ticker. Build a
  `company → ticker → CIK` map by reusing `extract_edgar._build_cik_map` so selected
  questions line up with our `edgar_*` tables.

---

## 5. Metrics & acceptance thresholds

| Layer | Metric | Definition | Initial gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | **Numeric match rate** | gold answer within ±tolerance of `edgar_facts` value (default 1% rel., unit-normalized) | ≥ 0.85 on in-scope metric Qs |
| E1 | **Coverage** | % of FinanceBench metric Qs whose concept+period exists in `edgar_facts` | report (diagnostic) |
| E2 | **Answer accuracy** | LLM-judge correct vs gold, given oracle passage | ≥ 0.70 |
| E3 | **Evidence recall@k** | gold evidence page/passage appears in retrieved top-k (k=5) | ≥ 0.60 |
| E3 | **Answer accuracy** | LLM-judge correct vs gold, full pipeline | ≥ 0.50 |
| E2/E3 | **Hallucination rate** | judged-incorrect **and** not a refusal (FinanceBench penalizes confident wrong answers) | ≤ 0.10 |
| E2/E3 | **Refusal rate** | "I don't have enough data…" (our prompt's escape hatch) | report |

Thresholds are first-pass placeholders — calibrate after a baseline run, then freeze as
regression gates. The **hallucination rate** is the headline metric: per the FinanceBench
paper, a confidently wrong financial answer is worse than a refusal.

> ⚠️ E2/E3 answer summaries degrade silently to "Query returned N rows." if `tabulate` is not
> installed (audit M2). Pin `tabulate` in `requirements.txt` before running these layers.

## 7. Phased implementation

**Phase 0 — Unblock (RESOLVED).**
1. [DONE] Fix H1: point `rag_engine.DUCKDB_PATH` at `DB_PATH` (`ibkr.duckdb`), delete `data/vectors.duckdb`.
2. [DONE] Fix H2: add `openai` / `anthropic` / `ollama` entries to `chat_engine._PROVIDERS`.
3. [DONE] Fix M1: change `embed_edgar.py:116` INSERT to be idempotent (DELETE before INSERT). *Note: EDGAREmbeddingsRetriever still needs wiring for full E3 coverage.*
4. [DONE] Fix M3: replace `._get_relevant_documents(q, run_manager=None)` calls in `_combined_retriever` with `retriever.invoke(q)`.
5. [DONE] Pin `tabulate` in `requirements.txt` (M2).
6. [DONE] Cleanup: Removed `data/ibkr.db` and editor temp files (audit L1, M4).
7. [PENDING] Extend `embed_edgar` (or add `evals/financebench/ingest.py`) to fetch a *specified* filing rather than only the latest 10-K.
8. [DONE] Add `evals/data/` + `evals/results/` to `.gitignore`.

**Phase 1 — Dataset layer.** `dataset.py`: load open subset, normalize fields, map
company→ticker→CIK, and emit scope flags (`e1_eligible` if concept+period in `_CONCEPTS`
and form in 10-K/10-Q; `e3_eligible` if filing ingestible). Cache to JSONL.

**Phase 2 — E1 extraction fidelity (highest ROI, no LLM).**
For each `e1_eligible` metric question: run `run_edgar_facts_etl` for its ticker, look up the
matching `(concept, period_end, form_type, unit)` in `edgar_facts`, compare to gold within
tolerance. Emit per-question pass/fail + the coverage number. This alone answers the original
ask: *are the extracted documents' numbers correct?*

**Phase 3 — E2 oracle.** `judge.py` + `run_e2_oracle.py`: feed the gold evidence passage as
`context` into the existing `_RAG_PROMPT`, call the provider, judge vs gold. Isolates
generation quality from retrieval.

**Phase 4 — E3 end-to-end.** Ingest each question's cited filing into our corpus, run
`ask_rag()`, compute evidence recall@k (compare retrieved chunks against gold evidence
page/text) and judged accuracy. Requires the Phase-0 retriever over `edgar_embeddings`.

**Phase 5 — Reporting + CI.** `report.py` aggregates to JSON + a markdown scorecard.
Add a **smoke test** (`tests/test_financebench_smoke.py`, 3–5 pinned items, mocked/cached
LLM) to CI so the harness can't silently break. Gate the *full* paid run behind a manual /
nightly workflow (it costs API calls + downloads PDFs) — keep it out of the PR `test` job.

---

## 8. CI integration notes

- **PR job:** smoke test only — offline, no API keys, no network (cache fixtures).
- **Nightly / manual `workflow_dispatch`:** full E1–E3 with secrets. Until H2 is fixed,
  only `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` / `MIMO_API_KEY` are valid judge secrets — do not add
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as judge secrets yet, as those providers will
  silently fall back to the DeepSeek endpoint and charge the wrong account or error out.
  Upload `evals/results/*` as a workflow artifact; fail if any frozen gate from §5 regresses.
- Widen the `ruff check` scope in `ci.yml` to include `evals/` (currently only covers
  `etl/ db/ config/ dashboard/` — `rag_engine.py` and `query.py` are also missing, per
  audit L8).
- Reuse `conftest.py` ibapi stubs; FinanceBench evals don't touch IBKR.

---

## 9. Risks & limitations

- **Non-commercial license** on the open subset — internal use only; don't redistribute.
- **Latest-only ingestion** (`embed_edgar`) makes E3 unfair until Phase-0 period-targeting
  lands; until then, run E3 against FinanceBench's *provided* PDFs as an oracle corpus.
- **Judge provider constraint (H2):** Until `chat_engine._PROVIDERS` is extended, only
  deepseek and mimo can be used as the judge. Using openai/anthropic/ollama will silently
  hit the DeepSeek API with the wrong key. Record the provider+model in every result row so
  runs are comparable.
- **Silent summary degradation (M2):** If `tabulate` is absent, `_summarise()` returns
  "Query returned N rows." for every E2/E3 item. Always verify `tabulate` is installed in
  the eval environment before interpreting LLM judge scores.
- **E3 retrieval fragility (M3):** `_combined_retriever` calls the private
  `._get_relevant_documents(query, run_manager=None)` API. A LangChain version bump
  that adds required callback logic would silently return empty results for all retrievers
  without raising an exception, causing E3 evidence recall to drop to 0. Fix M3 before
  pinning any LangChain version bump in requirements.
- **Duplicate chunks on ingest re-run (M1):** `embed_edgar.py:116` uses a bare `INSERT`,
  so `ingest.py` re-running for the same filing accumulates duplicate chunks. This inflates
  E3 chunk counts and can skew recall@k scores. Must be idempotent before Phase 4.
- **Judge variance / cost** — pin temperature 0, log model+version, sample-audit a slice of
  verdicts by hand before trusting the gate.
- **Concept name drift** — `_CONCEPTS` uses fixed us-gaap tags (e.g. `Revenues`,
  `RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax`). Some issuers report under different
  tags; E1 coverage will be < 100% and that's expected — report it, don't hide it.
- **Small open set (~150)** — treat numbers as directional, not statistically tight; report
  per-`question_type` and per-`doc_type` breakdowns.

---

## 10. Open decisions (need a call before Phase 1)

1. **Subset:** open 150 only, or pursue gated full 10,231? (default: open 150)
2. **Judge provider:** reuse `CHAT_PROVIDER`, or pin a dedicated judge model?
   (default: reuse, temp 0, recorded per row — **constrained to deepseek or mimo until H2
   is fixed**; do not select openai/anthropic/ollama until `_PROVIDERS` entries are added)
3. **E3 corpus:** our embedded `edgar_embeddings`, FinanceBench-provided PDFs, or both?
   (default: both — ours is the real test, theirs is the upper-bound oracle — **but only
   after M1 is fixed** so ingest is idempotent and the `EDGAREmbeddingsRetriever` is wired)
4. **Gate strictness:** advisory (report-only) first, or hard-fail CI immediately?
   (default: advisory for 1 baseline run, then freeze gates)
5. **M3 fix timing:** fix `_combined_retriever` to use `.invoke()` before Phase 4, or
   accept current fragility and note in the risk register? (default: fix before Phase 4)
